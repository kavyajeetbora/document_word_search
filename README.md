# Document Word Search

This program runs this way:

2. If the word is found, it returns a table containing all the sentences indexed by page number

For example:

Word: "Instrument" 

Returns all the sentences that contains the word and the corresponding page number in tabular form:
| Page Number  | Sentence |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 4  | She knew the essential conditions of the instrument.  |
| 13  | A knife is an instrument to cut with.  |
